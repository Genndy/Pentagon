---------------------

You may find all rules and controls in HELP menu.

h2 Rules
---------------------
Your goal is to place figures-pentaminoes (they consist of 5 squares hence the name) (furthermore, that's why
this game is called so) on the field 12x12 so they do not overlap each other even with corners (you create a
mosaic)

h3 Controls 
---------------------
LMB - choose a figure
RMB - place figure back to desk
MMB - use help, place chosen figure on place, computed by program (this way you can speedrun a game)
